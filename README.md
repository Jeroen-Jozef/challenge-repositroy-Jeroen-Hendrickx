## You can always count on me for

help with HTML, CSS and Javascript to some extent. But in fact feel free to ask me whatever is bothering you and I'll see if I can help out.

## Funny story

A few days ago I was having trouble with me ecard reader. Trying to fix it, swearing, calling helpdesk even, which is not something I usually do.
Erm... I had inserted the card upside down.

### TL;DR

If that was to long to read, I suggest you follow other classes first ;-)
